This guide walks you through setting up passwordless SSH access to the COH HPRCC clusters. While the examples use Apollo (`ppxhpcacc01.coh.org`), the same steps work for Gemini (`gemini-login1.coh.org`) or any other SSH host.

# Creating Your SSH Key

First, you'll need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine:

```
# Generate a new SSH key (the -C flag adds a comment)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@coh.org"

# Press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_ed25519)
# Optionally set a passphrase when prompted
```

For Windows users: Run these commands in Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

# Adding Your Key to the Cluster

Now you'll copy your public key to the cluster:

1. View your public key:
   ```
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

2. Copy the entire output - it should look like:
   `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI... your_email@coh.org`

3. Log into the cluster:
   ```
   ssh your_username@ppxhpcacc01.coh.org
   ```

4. Set up the authorized keys file:
   ```
   # Create .ssh directory if it doesn't exist
   mkdir -p ~/.ssh
   chmod 700 ~/.ssh
   
   # Edit authorized_keys (we'll use nano)
   nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

5. Paste your public key into the file. In nano:
   - Paste with Ctrl+Shift+V or right-click
   - Save with Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter

6. Set the right permissions:
   ```
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

# Testing Your Setup

1. Log out of the cluster (type `exit` or press Ctrl+D)
2. Try logging in again:
   ```
   ssh your_username@ppxhpcacc01.coh.org
   ```

You should now connect without being asked for a password.

# Making Life Easier: SSH Config

Create or edit `~/.ssh/config` on your local machine to set up shortcuts:

```
# ~/.ssh/config
Host apollo
    HostName ppxhpcacc01.coh.org
    User your_username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Host gemini
    HostName gemini-login1.coh.org
    User your_username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Now you can connect with just:
```
ssh apollo
# or
ssh gemini
```

# Security Notes

- Never share or expose your private key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`)
- Only add your public key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) to authorized servers
- Use a strong passphrase if your laptop/workstation is shared or accessible by others

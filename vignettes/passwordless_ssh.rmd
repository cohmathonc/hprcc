This guide will help you set up passwordless SSH access from your local machine (Mac, Windows, or Linux) to Apollo (`ppxhpcacc01.coh.org`); the same will work for Gemini (`gemini-login1.coh.org`) or any other ssh host, including internode sessions on the HPC.

## 🖥️ Local Machine Setup (Mac, Windows, Linux)

1. Generate an SSH key pair (if you don't already have one):
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@coh.org"
```
   Press Enter to accept the default file location and enter a passphrase if desired.


> [!NOTE]
> For Windows, use Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run these commands.

## 📤 Copy Your Public Key to Apollo HPC

2. Display your public key:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

3. Copy the output of the above command.

4. SSH into Apollo HPC:
```bash
ssh your_username@ppxhpcacc01.coh.org
```

5. Once logged in, create or edit the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

6. Paste your public key into this file, save, and exit (in `nano`, use `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then Enter).

7. Set the correct permissions:
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

## 🔒 Test Your Passwordless SSH Connection

8. Exit from Apollo HPC and try to SSH in again:
```bash
ssh your_username@ppxhpcacc01.coh.org
```

You should now be able to log in without entering a password.

> [!TIP]
> To make your SSH experience even smoother, you can create an alias in your local `~/.ssh/config` file:
> ```
> Host apollo
>     HostName ppxhpcacc01.coh.org
>     User your_username
>     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
> ```
> After adding this, you can simply use `ssh apollo` to connect.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep your private key (id_ed25519) secure and never share it with anyone!

Happy computing on the HPC! 🚀

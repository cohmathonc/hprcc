\title{Run Shiny app to explore autometric log data}
\usage{
explore_logs(path = NULL, targets_file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to _targets/logs directory. If NULL, will attempt to find logs in default location}

\item{targets_file}{Path to _targets.R file for reading target resource configurations.
If NULL, will attempt to auto-detect from path.}
}
\value{
A Shiny application object
}
\description{
Launch an interactive Shiny application for visualizing and analyzing resource usage logs created by
the \href{https://wlandau.github.io/autometric/}{autometric} package. The app provides plots and statistics
for memory usage, CPU utilization, and task completion times, and resource request suggestions.
}
\details{
The application provides:
\itemize{
\item Interactive plots for memory, CPU usage and wall time analysis
\item Resource usage statistics by job
\item Analysis of usage patterns
\item Controller recommendations based on observed resource requirements
}

The recommendations panel uses the \verb{_targets.R} file to determine which controller
each target is configured to use, then compares actual resource usage against
controller specifications to suggest optimizations.

\examples{
\dontrun{
explore_logs()
explore_logs("path/to/logs")
explore_logs("path/to/logs", targets_file = "path/to/_targets.R")
}

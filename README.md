# hprcc <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="120" alt="" />
  
An R Package to simplify running analyses on City of Hope clusters _Apollo_ and _Gemini_

## Features

**hprcc** configures [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) pipelines for COH clusters _Apollo_ and _Gemini_. Targets provides a simple but powerful framework for running R code. It avoids unnecessary computation for tasks that are up to date, natively supports parallel computing and abstracts files as R objects. Also included are some handy functions for logging R jobs run via SLURM.

You can easily configure your own SLURM resource requests (CPU, RAM, walltime) to run multiprocess jobs on cluster nodes with `create_controller()` or use pre-configured shortcuts according to the job type:

| Job Type    | CPUs | Memory (GB) | Time (minutes) |
|-------------|------|-------------|----------------|
| tiny        | 2    | 8           | 60             |
| small       | 2    | 20          | 360            |
| medium      | 4    | 40          | 360            |
| large       | 8    | 80          | 360            |
| large_mem   | 8    | 800         | 360            |
| xlarge      | 20   | 200         | 360            |
| huge        | 40   | 200         | 120            |
| gpu_medium^†^ | 4    | 60          | 120            |
| gpu_large^†^ | 8    | 120         | 240            |

^†^ GPUs only available on _Gemini_

For a complete list of configurable settings refer to the [package options](reference/package-options.html).

## Usage

Load the library via `_targets.R` and set resources within `tar_target()` steps. By default, all targets will run on the cluster with a `small` allocation.

```
library(targets)    
tar_script({
    library(hprcc)
    list(
        tar_target(y1, 1 + 1, deployment = "main"),
        tar_target(y2, 1 + 1, resources = tiny),
        tar_target(z, y1 + y2, resources = small)
    )}, ask = FALSE)
tar_make()
```

## Installation

To install this package, you can use the `remotes` package in R:

```r
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("cohmathonc/hprcc")
```
